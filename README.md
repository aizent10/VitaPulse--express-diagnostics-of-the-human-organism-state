VitaPulse: express diagnostics of the human organism state and disease prevention

What is «VitaPulse»? 
App «VitaPulse» is for anyone interested in their own health and care for him. With this application, any person can independently control his/her functional health state, to learn their level of health assessment, adaptability of the organism, the level of stress, balance expenditure / recovering energy, as well as improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of unexpected health problems.

How does it work?
Mobile app pulse diagnosis «VitaPulse» real-time measures and monitors heart rate. This does not require any expensive special sensors or devices, as everything is done using only the built-in camera of your smartphone. The camera flash shines through finger, so there is a pulse reading ripple. Since the blood circulation is a direct function of the heart's contractions, it gives information on the frequency of heart rate detection. After pulse being detected, the registration of the interpulse intervals and recording of the cardiointervalogram are conducted. The duration of each cardiac cycle differs from the previous and application is estimated with an accuracy of one millisecond. Sequential change durations cardiac cycles forms a complex rhythm that is analyzed by the application.
After the end of the survey the software automatically calculates mathematical processing and estimate the indicators of the human body, based on heart rate variability (HRV), a modern method for the study of functional diagnostics. HRV is used in various fields of applied physiology, preventive medicine, clinical practice and allows you to determine the current state of the organism, the mechanisms of regulation, functional and adaptive human reserves, as well as timely reveal abnormalities in the body when there are no clinical manifestations of the disease, but is already a running "trigger" for its occurrence.

Why the need «VitaPulse»?
1. Regular monitoring of the health status of all family members. Allows you to stop waiting when the disease was coming suddenly, and respond in advance.

«VitaPulse» help control the current level of stress and live a long life. 
Information about what the stress level is dangerous, has been well studied by scientists and is expressed as a clear digital indicators. These scientific data have been developed and are now available to any user «VitaPulse».
3. «VitaPulse» easily integrated into many methods of treatment and self-medication. Massage, wellness exercises, physiotherapy, herbal medicine, yoga, fitness, medication, etc. - all this requires monitoring. Regular monitoring of the functional status before and after the procedures will evaluate the effectiveness of the selected method and, if necessary, correct it.
4. «VitaPulse» applies in sports practice for early detection of problems organism adaptation to physical stress and overtraining state, implementation of immediate control over the process of physical training with a view to optimization, which is a prerequisite for achieving high results.
